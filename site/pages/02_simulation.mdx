# Simulation

Simulation are described by two sections: script and shape expression(s).

## Script

```rust
struct Hailstone;

impl Hailstone {
  pub fn new(args) { Self }

  pub fn register_bot(bot) {
    bot.register_action(ActionTrigger::alive(100.0), Self::do_nothing);
  }

  pub async fn do_nothing(self) {
    println("doing nothing ...")
  }
}
```

## Shape expression

For each model defined in the script a shape expression can be defined.

Expressions are evaluated by hailstorm once a second by valorizing t variable with the number of seconds passed from the start of the simulation.
Instances of the model are then created or removed to match the count.
